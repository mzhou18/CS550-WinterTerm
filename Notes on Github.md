Notes on Github

* What is Github?
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.

# Things you should know for the quiz

* Creating a repository
A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Including a README, or a file with information about your project, is helpful because this will let you immediately clone the repository to your computer.

* Branches
Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
We have one main branch named master the master branch.

To create a new branch, click the drop down says "branch: master," and then type a branch name.

* Commit

Saved changes are called commits. To make a commit, (1) click the README.md file, 
(2) click the pencil icon, and (3) write a commit message that describe the changes.

* Pull request

When you open a pull request, youâ€™re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch (you may also accept your own pull requests).

To do so, click the Pull Request tab, then click on the green New pull request button. Select the branch you made edits to compare with master.

To merge the pull request, (1) click the green Merge pull request button to merge the changes into master, (2) click Confirm merge, and (3) delete the branch.

* Reverting

To revert, click on the commit that you want to revert to, copy the contents of the file you want to revert, and replace the current file with the new content.

Note: Zhi helped me with reverting.

* Markdown
Markdown is a way to style text on the web.

Examples include:
**bold**
*italic*

* Cloning/fork
A fork, similar to cloning, is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

* Github desktop app
Steps that apply on the website apply similarly to this app. Don't forget to hit publish!
